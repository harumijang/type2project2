              largely shutting out Black Americans.

            Linda Koulisis sensed an opportunity. It was September 2016, and
            Koulisis, a talent agent and former film producer based in Los
            Angeles, was in New York for a special screening of Charles
            Burnett’s “To Sleep With Anger,” a critically admired but
            little-seen film she had worked on in 1990.
          </p>
          <p>
            Burnett, who is African-American, was also in town for the
            screening. And Koulisis, who is white, joined him for an appointment
            with the Criterion Collection, the producer of a revered DVD and
            Blu-ray line of classic and contemporary films that has existed in
            various forms since 1984.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the company’s office in Gramercy Park, Koulisis found herself
            face to face with Peter Becker, Criterion’s longtime president and
            creative lead, who is also white. Burnett hadn’t come to discuss his
            own film (he had been asked to record an interview about a film by
            another director, the Italian Ermanno Olmi), but Koulisis steered
            the conversation toward “To Sleep With Anger.” No one had ever
            produced a DVD or Blu-ray of the film, she told Becker. Would
            Criterion be interested in becoming the first?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Criterion edition of “To Sleep With Anger” — released less than
            three years after the meeting with Becker, in 2019 — put Burnett in
            rarefied company. He is one of only two living Black Americans to
            have a feature-length film in the collection, which comprises more
            than 1,000 films by more than 450 directors. There are just four
            African-American directors with feature films in the collection
            overall, or less than 1 percent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is a cinematic canon even more highbrow than the Oscars,
            it’s the Criterion Collection, where directors are treated with a
            level of awe usually afforded to movie stars and a film’s critical
            reputation outweighs its box office receipts. Criterion began in the
            1980s as a producer of high-end laser discs, and pioneered several
            special features for that format — letterboxing, director’s
            commentary tracks, deleted scenes — that would later become industry
            standards. Today, the company, which is privately held, oversees a
            sister streaming service with an independent catalog — the Criterion
            Channel — and employs a staff of around 50.
          </p>
          <p>
            Its physical collection continues to grow by 50 to 60 new or
            reissued titles each year, all digitally reproduced to exacting
            specifications and packaged with eye-catching original artwork. It
            is well known for including works by many of the most highly
            regarded filmmakers of all time — Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese,
            Akira Kurosawa and Jean-Luc Godard among them — alongside a select
            number of contemporary directors, like Wes Anderson, Guillermo del
            Toro and Richard Linklater.
          </p>
          <p>
            That extensive range has created the impression among some
            cinephiles, including many who work in the industry, of an
            authoritative survey. In a recent newsletter circulated by
            Criterion, Anderson called the collection a “Louvre of movies.” And
            publications like Vanity Fair and Entertainment Weekly have compared
            it to a one-stop film school.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I think in a community of filmmakers, actors and people who are
            knowledgeable about cinema, that Criterion stamp means a lot,” said
            Prof. Todd Boyd, the chair for the study of race and popular culture
            at the University of Southern California. “It’s like a Good
            Housekeeping seal of approval. It’s a stamp of cultural and
            filmmaking relevance.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In such an expansive catalog, encompassing films from more than 40
            countries, the relative absence of African-American filmmakers
            stands out. There are, for example, more directors in the Criterion
            Collection with the last name Anderson than there are
            African-Americans.
          </p>
          <span>
            A New York Times analysis of the collection through June 30 found
            that of 1,034 feature-length films released by Criterion in the
            DVD/Blu-ray era, there were...
          </span>
          <p>
            Women and other people of color appeared in slightly larger numbers.
            About 11 percent of directors were Asian; 2 percent were Latino; and
            about 7 percent were women.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When you’re Criterion and you have the ability to stamp something
            and say, ‘This is valuable,’ but the list only includes certain
            films and certain filmmakers, that speaks for itself,” Boyd said.
            “If someone looking at it doesn’t see that many Black filmmakers,
            without even thinking about it, they’d probably assume that Black
            filmmakers aren’t that important, or at least they don’t make the
            kind of critically acclaimed movies you might see in the
            collection.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a thorny topic that Black directors have been discussing among
            themselves for decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You always wanted as a filmmaker to be part of the Criterion
            Collection, you’re always hoping for that call,” said Gina
            Prince-Bythewood, the director of acclaimed Black-led dramas like
            “Love & Basketball” and “Beyond the Lights.” Though Criterion has
            never reached out to her, Prince-Bythewood still feels a rush of
            anticipation when the company announces new titles. “Every month,
            they put out an alert about their films coming out, and every month,
            I open it to see if they’re going to highlight any Black
            filmmakers,” she said. “And it never happens.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In an interview this month with The New York Times, the Criterion
            president, Peter Becker, who owns a minority stake in the company,
            expressed regret about the lack of Black representation in the
            collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s nothing I can say about it that will make it OK,” he said.
            “The fact that things are missing, and specifically that Black
            voices are missing, is harmful, and that’s clear. We have to fix
            that.”
          </p>
          <h4>Keepers of the Canon</h4>
          <p>
            Though it has released contemporary titles since the laser disc era,
            the Criterion Collection has deep roots in the classic film canon.
            Its founders, including the multimedia publishing pioneers Bob Stein
            and Aleen Stein, the former Warner Bros. executive Roger Smith and
            the producer Joe Medjuck, started the company in 1984 on the back of
            two landmarks of American cinema, “Citizen Kane” and “King Kong.”
          </p>
          <p>
            That same year, Criterion formed a strategic distribution
            partnership with another company, Janus Films, owned at the time by
            Becker’s father, William Becker, and Saul J. Turell, father of the
            current Criterion chief executive, Jonathan Turell. Janus, founded
            in Harvard Square in 1956, had distinguished itself as among the
            first American companies to promote foreign art-house films,
            including the work of Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and
            François Truffaut.
          </p>
          <p>
            Peter Becker, who became president of Criterion in 1997, is also a
            co-owner of Janus Films. And he inherited its value system, defined
            by what he described as a “quite canonical and traditional” catalog.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he sought to expand it, Becker, 56, often looked to films and
            filmmakers that he felt were cut from a similar cloth. “I was
            working on what was in front of me based on my own experience and
            community,” he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, that community came to include a contemporaneous
            generation of North American directors, largely white and male, who
            idolized Janus Films. Some, including Wes Anderson and Paul Dano
            (“Wildlife”), became personal friends of Becker’s. Others, like
            Alexander Payne (“Election”) and Greg Mottola (“The Daytrippers”),
            appear in promotional materials for Criterion, including popular web
            videos highlighting its vast DVD closet, and a series of Top 10
            lists.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was to this community that Charles Burnett and Linda Koulisis
            gained entree after meeting with Becker in 2016, clearing the path
            for “To Sleep With Anger.” Before their visit, Becker hadn’t seen
            the film, according to Koulisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amy Heller, president of Milestone Films, another archival movie
            distributor that released an earlier Burnett title, “Killer of
            Sheep,” in 2007, said that many film ranking systems historically
            have been forged in echo chambers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The overwhelming majority of the filmmakers anointed, like the
            people who chose them, were white men,” she said. “The world they
            live in affirms their knowledge, acumen, taste and authority.” The
            result, Heller said, is a canon iterated so often that it can begin
            to feel “monumental and eternal.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The folks who are left out of the lists start to become literally
            personae non grata,” she continued. “Not worth talking about, or
            hiring, or watching.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Burnett succeeded in joining the Criterion set, other Black
            filmmakers may choose not to make the effort, assuming that they are
            unwelcome. That was the case for Haile Gerima, a peer of Burnett’s
            and the director of the trailblazing “Sankofa” (1993). For Gerima,
            the Criterion Collection brings back memories of what he called the
            “independent white American film movement” of the 1990s.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Our experience never allowed us to even think of the possibility of
            having a relationship with them, because I just feel their very
            standard is very white supremacist,” he said.
          </p>
          <h4>‘Blind Spots’</h4>
          <p>
            Becker said that the lack of African-American films in the
            collection is in part a reflection of his personal “blind spots.”
            These were at play, for example, in his initial reaction to Julie
            Dash’s “Daughters of the Dust” (1991), the first theatrically
            released film directed by an African-American woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1992, Dash, who studied the Criterion Collection as a graduate
            film student at the AFI Conservatory and the University of
            California, Los Angeles, sent Becker a copy of “Daughters” via her
            distributor, Donald Krim of Kino International. The film, praised by
            critics for its dreamlike, multigenerational portrayal of a Gullah
            community on Georgia’s St. Simons Island, is often cited as an
            influence for Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” But Becker turned it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I didn’t understand what I was looking at,” he said, reflecting on
            the decision. “I didn’t understand it for what it was. And I wasn’t
            talking with people who were going to help me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, Dash said, she had assumed that Criterion simply didn’t
            “get” her movie. But she later reconsidered. “It’s more than ‘They
            don’t get it,’” she said. “It has to do with worldview. They don’t
            care to get it. They’re not interested.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though “Daughters” never appeared in the Criterion Collection (in
            2016, it was reissued in a digitally restored special edition by
            another company, the Cohen Film Collection), it was added to the
            Criterion Channel, the company’s streaming service, this spring. In
            June, following the global protests prompted by the police killing
            of George Floyd, the film was made available for free on the
            service, and featured prominently on its home page as part of a
            special “Black Lives” package.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Dash, the about-face was a welcome surprise. “What a change,
            after 30 years,” she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Criterion’s blind spots have extended to the most recent generation
            of African-American filmmakers. Though the collection features the
            directorial debuts of multiple generations of white auteurs —
            including Gus Van Sant, Noah Baumbach, David Gordon Green and Lena
            Dunham — it has no African-American directors born after 1957.
          </p>
          <p>
            One who potentially could have been included is Barry Jenkins, who
            directed the best-picture winner “Moonlight” (2016). Jenkins’s
            influential debut feature, “Medicine for Melancholy” (2009), is
            distributed by IFC, which has enjoyed a long-running relationship
            with the Criterion Collection. Other IFC films, including Dunham’s
            “Tiny Furniture” (2010) and Dano’s “Wildlife” (2018), received
            Criterion editions within two years of their release.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Becker, who said he hoped to add “Medicine” to the collection in
            the near future, acknowledged that he had only recently seen the
            film: “I will admit that I didn’t know ‘Medicine for Melancholy’
            when it came out.” He first reached out to Jenkins about acquiring
            distribution rights in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            The director Ava DuVernay, who founded a distribution company,
            ARRAY, focused on the work of people of color and women, said that
            Criterion had contributed to “cinema segregation in the art-house
            circuit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are all these gates that are closed to Black filmmakers,” she
            said. “It’s a minimizing of the Black film canon. But also it’s a
            minimizing of the audience, to think that they wouldn’t be
            interested in Haile Gerima’s ‘Sankofa,’ or ‘Ashes and Embers,’ or
            would not want to see all the work of Julie Dash, or Kathleen
            Collins, or Charles Burnett, and on and on.”
          </p>
          <p>
            DuVernay said that Criterion had passed on her own film, “Middle of
            Nowhere” (2012), for which she became the first Black filmmaker to
            win the directing prize at Sundance. “There wasn’t any rights
            issue,” said DuVernay, who owns the movie. “It was just a pass.” In
            an emailed statement, Becker said he had no record or memory of
            this, and offered to release “Middle of Nowhere” on Blu-ray.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If Ava would want to work on a special edition with us, we would be
            honored and would just need her help to get Lionsgate to say yes,”
            he wrote, referring to the film’s current distributor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Criterion Collection wasn’t always quite as white as it is now.
            In the early 1990s, it put out several acclaimed films by Black
            directors on laser disc, including Melvin Van Peebles’s “Sweet
            Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song,” John Singleton’s “Boyz N the Hood,”
            Spike Lee’s “She’s Gotta Have It,” and the Hughes brothers films
            “Menace II Society” and “Dead Presidents.” But none of those titles
            survived the transition, in 1998, to DVD.
          </p>
          <p>
            Becker said they had initially been lost because of rights issues.
            “In the beginnings of a marketplace, things are less available,” he
            said. But a significant majority of Criterion’s laser discs did
            migrate to the newer formats eventually, and Becker acknowledged
            that he could have done more over the years to reintroduce those by
            Black filmmakers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know where those rights are, and I can go seek out those rights,
            and I will,” he said. “We’ve done second Blu-ray editions of other
            things; we should go do second Blu-ray editions of those, too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For the Hughes brothers, who said that they had been honored to be
            included in the collection in the 1990s, the damage has already been
            done. “How dare that be an oversight?” Albert Hughes said. “You
            should know better.”
          </p>
          <h4>‘We Looked Up and Looked Around’</h4>
          <p>
            Becker said his company began trying to address the racial and
            gender disparities in its catalog around five years ago. That had
            been one of the objectives of FilmStruck, the now defunct streaming
            service that Criterion started in partnership with Turner Classic
            Movies in 2016.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We looked up, looked around, and went, ‘Oh my God, we have to
            actually really deal with the fact that, one edition at a time,
            we’ve knit together something that is almost all male and
            predominantly white,’” Becker said.
          </p>

            The Criterion Channel, which was begun last year as a spiritual
            successor to FilmStruck, has been at the forefront of that diversity
            push, Becker said. Because streaming rights are available at a lower
            comparative cost to DVD and Blu-ray, and because the Criterion
            Channel doesn’t require the resource-intensive special features of
            the physical collection, the company has quickly generated a less
            homogeneous streaming catalog.

            But the physical collection, which has greater cachet among
            cinephiles and in film schools, has not kept up. In the past five
            years, out of hundreds of new physical editions, only two — “To
            Sleep With Anger” and “Bamboozled” — have been works by Black
            Americans. Another — a reissue of “The Learning Tree,” the debut
            feature by the pioneering African-American director Gordon Parks —
            is planned for next year.

            To diversify the collection, Becker said, he is assembling a
            “curatorial advisory group” that will work with him to identify
            acquisition targets, and prevent the exclusion of the next Julie
            Dash or Barry Jenkins. He also plans to hire more Black employees;
            there are none currently at leadership levels.

            “We’re just beginning senior leadership coaching for all of our
            management teams in terms of antiracist hiring practices,” Becker
            said.

            Boyd, of the University of Southern California, said Criterion was
            an example of how the unexamined racial biases of cultural
            institutions can have pernicious and long-lasting effects, even
            without overtly racist intent. “It’s not the ‘segregation today,
            segregation tomorrow, segregation forever’ kind of racism,” Boyd
            said. “It’s the sort of racism rooted in assumptions about what’s
            relevant, what’s significant, what’s worth seeing, what’s
            important.”

            Near the end of his interview with The Times, Becker said that he
            had come to recognize as much himself. “I think canons end up being
            defined as much by what they leave out,” he said, “as by what they
            let in.”
