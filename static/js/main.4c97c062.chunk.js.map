The academy has admitted thousands of new\n            members over the last three years, with an emphasis on women and\n            people of color.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But the Oscar voting pool (about 9,000 film professionals)\n            nonetheless remains 68 percent male and 84 percent white, according\n            to academy data.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            At this point, most of the leading Oscar handicappers — Anne\n            Thompson of Indiewire, Glenn Whipp of The Los Angeles Times, Tim\n            Gray of Variety — are predicting that the academy will put forward\n            an all-male field for best director. Other categories could be\n            similar. The front-runners for adapted screenplay are all men, with\n            the exception of Gerwig, according to Gold Derby, an awards\n            prognostication site.

Ashton\n            Kutcher as a Bollywood producer, Raj, in a 2012 commercial, his skin\n            darkened, a brown mustache affixed to his face, speaking in a cheap\n            singsong voice, swaying his body, which is clad in a bright blue\n            silk sherwani, back and forth to imitate the Indian head waggle.\n            Tilda Swinton, otherworldly in her beauty, as always, but monkishly\n            bald as the Ancient One, a character originally intended to be\n            Tibetan, in 2016’s “Doctor Strange.” More subtle, but still just as\n            shocking: Emma Stone — blonde and green-eyed — as Allison Ng,\n            leaning against a kitchen island in a scene from 2015’s “Aloha” and\n            saying, “My dad was half Chinese, half Hawaiian,” as breezily as if\n            she were saying goodbye to someone on the telephone.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I, too, am half Chinese, though I have always been told (by other\n            Chinese-Americans, by white people who were under the impression I\n            was one of them) that I’m not the right kind of Chinese.

They also spoke to a part of me, the\n            Chinese half of me, that never felt it could behave as carelessly as\n            the other half of me did.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            THERE HAVE BEEN attempts by Hollywood to insert real people of color\n            — in this case, Asian-Americans — into the cultural landscape of\n            film and television.

The television reboot\n            “Hawaii Five-0” has added more nuanced Asian characters who were\n            missing from the original version, played by actors such as{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Grace Park\", 5)}, {this.redText(\"Daniel Dae Kim\", 6)}{\" \"}\n            or {this.redText(\"Masi Oka\", 7)}, and newer creations, including\n            “Silicon Valley,” have cast {this.redText(\"Jimmy O.

But these are still small\n            changes, and this so-called progress rings hollow. You remain\n            unlikely to see Asian-Americans in lead roles in big studios films\n            without the hint of tokenism, even after the box office success of\n            this year’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” the first studio film with an\n            all-Asian cast since “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Representation of Asians within American performing arts has always\n            been alarmingly small. A recent study by the University of Southern\n            California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism\n            showed Asian-Americans representing only 1 percent of all leading\n            roles in Hollywood (the 2017 United States Census Bureau reported\n            that there are 18 million Americans of Asian descent, or roughly 6\n            percent of the population).

This\n            year, Sandra Oh made history as the first woman of Asian descent to\n            be nominated for an Emmy for the lead in a dramatic series, as Eve\n            Polastri in “Killing Eve.” And earlier this year, the\n            Indian-American actor {this.redText(\"Aziz Ansari\", 21)} was awarded\n            best actor for a TV comedy by the Golden Globes, the first actor of\n            Asian descent to do so. When “Saturday Night Live” announced that\n            the actor {this.redText(\"Awkwafina\", 22)} would host the show this\n            past October, it was noted that the last woman of Asian descent to\n            host was {this.redText(\"Lucy Liu\", 23)} in 2000, 18 years ago. The\n            New York Times recently reported that in the search for the male\n            lead in “Crazy Rich Asians,” one of the movie’s producers was told\n            by several prominent American theater schools that they hadn’t had a\n            male Asian graduate in years. A study by multiple universities\n            reported that, over a one-year period, of the 242 scripted shows on\n            broadcast, cable and streaming TV, just one-third had a series\n            regular who was Asian-American or Pacific Islander. These are shows,\n            mind you, set in cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los\n            Angeles, which all have significant Asian-American and Pacific\n            Islander populations (33 percent, 12 percent and 24 percent,\n            respectively). And another report by the U.S.C. Annenberg Inclusion\n            Initiative stated that of the top 100 films of last year, 37 didn’t\n            include a single Asian character with a speaking role.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Yet elsewhere in the arts, Asian-Americans have flourished: as\n            poets, writers, directors, photographers, fashion designers,\n            architects, interior decorators and visual artists. The creative\n            offerings of Asian-Americans — from{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Vera Wang’s\", 24)}\n            fantasy wedding dresses to the fiction of{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Jhumpa Lahiri\", 25)} to the haunting cinematography\n            of {this.redText(\"Hiro Murai\", 26)}, the director of Donald Glover’s\n            television show “Atlanta” — aren’t just accepted but celebrated.\n            Only in the representational arts do Asians remain unseen — mostly\n            in film and television, but in music, too, and, to a lesser degree,\n            on the runway.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In other words: It is only when we are hidden that we are allowed to\n            succeed. Which leads to a more troubling but inevitable conclusion:\n            that there is something about the very physiognomy of the Asian face\n            that American audiences still cannot or will not accept.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            EXOTIC, OPPORTUNISTIC prostitutes. Sexless, emasculated eunuchs.\n            Submissive young girls. Savage, untamed creatures. Coolies. Filth.\n            The earliest stereotypes about Asian-Americans were formed after the\n            first wave of immigration in the mid-1800s, when Chinese immigrants\n            were brought in by the thousands to help build the railroads that\n            would eventually crisscross the western half of the nation. They\n            were cheaper than American and European laborers, and they were made\n            to work longer hours. But they were also hired because they were\n            willing (though did they really have a choice?) to do the more\n            dangerous work — clearing the path along perilous mountain ridges\n            with dynamite, blowing up granite rock to create tunnels, often\n            getting trapped inside mountains or swept away in avalanches — that\n            others refused to do.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Their arrival was called the Yellow Peril. Asian immigrants were\n            seen as invasive and threatening to an entire American way of life,\n            and over the next century, a series of laws were passed that\n            excluded first the Chinese, but then also those from other Asian\n            countries. By 1924, all Asian immigrants (with the exception of\n            those from the Philippines, a country that had been annexed by the\n            United States) were refused citizenship, naturalization, land\n            ownership and, in some states, prevented from marrying those of\n            another race.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Hollywood capitalized on these fears accordingly in their creations\n            of Fu Manchu and Charlie Chan. The former, a calculating villain who\n            appeared in a series of films beginning in the 1920s (the name,\n            invented by its British creator, is a crude jingoist rhyme, neither\n            Mandarin nor Cantonese), is a mask of a Chinese man, always\n            portrayed with crudely slanted eyes, eyebrows like caterpillars and\n            a thin dangling beard. The latter was a benevolent but subservient\n            detective in a bowler hat who was popularized by a series of white\n            actors in dozens of films beginning in the 1920s and into the 1980s.\n            And even if Asian men weren’t portrayed as the yellow-faced villain\n            or the neutered helpmate, they were still always the other. As with\n            almost any reviled minority group in America, the fear traces back\n            to sex — the men were either sexless or sex-crazed. The women were\n            conniving dragon ladies or docile concubines.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            It was only in 1965, when immigration laws changed again, and the\n            United States eliminated national-origin quotas and introduced a\n            preference system based on family relationships as well as skills,\n            that a new wave of Asian immigrants arrived. With them came a new\n            stereotype, one that persists today: the model minority —\n            competitive, goal-oriented and hard-working (but, notably, lacking\n            in creativity, charm, sex appeal and humor). A recent lawsuit\n            against Harvard University revealed how it systematically\n            discriminates against Asian-American applicants, alleging that\n            though Asian-American students consistently performed higher than\n            other applicants when it came to test scores, grades and\n            extracurriculars, they were consistently given lower scores for\n            “positive personality,” likability, courage, kindness and being\n            “widely respected,” according to the 160,000 student records\n            included in the lawsuit’s filing. (Harvard has denied the charges.)\n          </p>\n          <p>Inscrutable. High-achieving. Soulless. </p>\n          <p>\n            Why is it that the challenges of becoming part of a new country, of\n            overcoming an immense language barrier or working twice as hard and\n            twice as long are so rarely prized? I think often of the leap, for\n            example, my mother made immigrating to this country from Taiwan, and\n            how much she lost in translation. It’s the little things you forget\n            to explain or can’t, at least right away, put into words. For years,\n            my mother would tell me she was afraid of snakes, and I never\n            understood why until we visited the house where she grew up in\n            Keelung, a port city in northern Taiwan where the weather can shift\n            in an instant, blue sky darkening to black. There, alongside a small\n            garden, was a creek, and as we passed it, my mother remarked that\n            that was where the bodies of dead snakes accumulated after each\n            typhoon. The Chinese-American writer Weike Wang’s short story\n            “Omakase,” published this year in The New Yorker, captures this\n            cultural muteness as well. In it, a young Chinese-American woman\n            goes on a date with her white boyfriend to a sushi restaurant in\n            Harlem. His relative ease in the restaurant and in his interactions\n            with the Japanese chef show, on the one hand, a charismatic\n            personality. But on the other, it reveals a white man’s assumption\n            of being understood, in being welcome. It causes, at one point, the\n            protagonist to reflect on an earlier moment when she introduced her\n            boyfriend to her parents:\n          </p>\n          <span>\n            Her mother was a housewife. Back in China, they’d had different\n            jobs. Her father had been a computer-science professor and her\n            mother had been a salesclerk, but their success in those former\n            roles had hinged on being loquacious and witty in their native\n            language, none of which translated into English.\n          </span>\n          <p>\n            It’s an obvious but understated point — the lack of charisma and\n            expression that the protagonist’s father possesses in English is not\n            because he is a humorless and charmless man, but that the nuances of\n            such expression are not, at that moment, available to him. It calls\n            to mind the coded language used to describe Asians and\n            Asian-Americans: “hard-working” instead of brilliant, “diligent” but\n            not dazzling, “focused” but not naturally gifted.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But even if we can prove to you that we are as good as you, the\n            underlying message we get from the culture is that there is\n            something else that separates us, some quality that’s impossible to\n            quantify — originality, spark, winsome impulsivity, intuition. We\n            are tireless workers, but all that diligence amounts to in the eyes\n            of others is a kind of empty ambition. We don’t seduce, we don’t\n            inspire, we don’t go by our gut. These are skills the American\n            workplace fetishizes, and it has been decided that we don’t possess\n            them. Recent studies have found that Asian-Americans are the least\n            likely of all races to be promoted into managerial positions.\n          </p>\n          <p>The bamboo ceiling. </p>\n          <p>\n            And so it all comes back to how we are allowed to see ourselves on\n            the screen: worker bees but not the inventor. Comical helpmeets but\n            never the alpha. Filial sons and daughters who have abandoned\n            emotional fulfillment in order to satisfy our parents. These\n            stereotypes are, not incidentally, the absolute inverse of the types\n            and tropes celebrated in American cinema: the rebel, the bad boy,\n            the iconoclast, the prankster. The people we worship in our popular\n            culture — from James Dean to Steve Jobs, Marilyn Monroe to Princess\n            Diana — don’t play by the rules. It’s a Western myth that those we\n            love distinguish themselves by their differences, that their faults\n            are their virtues. Asians are seen differently: pathetic\n            perfectionists who never got the meaning of life, who’re unable to\n            live with abandon and therefore with romance. And that is why we\n            will never be compelling enough to be the hero in your eyes.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            IN WATCHING MOVIES, we project. It’s a basic impulse. We identify\n            with who we see. We feel what the characters feel, perhaps because\n            once in our life, we experienced something close to what the actor\n            is living on the screen, even if our version was less dramatic, less\n            violent. Very rarely do the stakes in our lives rise so high, nor do\n            the contours of a movie mimic the passage of time that defines our\n            existence — but the intensity of feeling can’t be diminished when we\n            relate to someone else’s experience, when we see what we know being\n            reenacted, and understand it to be true.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            After the release this past summer of “Crazy Rich Asians,” a\n            romantic comedy about a young woman who discovers her boyfriend’s\n            enormous wealth (and one of only three major Hollywood films ever to\n            have a majority Asian cast), I’ve fantasized about recasting various\n            classic American films with faces that look like mine. What if\n            “Ferris Bueller” took place in Pasadena and not Chicago, if its\n            projection of youthful freedom and dilettantish attention span —\n            youth is now, and now is free — were something you could see played\n            out among a well-to-do Chinese family? Or if “The Graduate” was\n            about Mrs. Kwan, not Mrs. Robinson, a complex woman with whom we\n            could understand the isolation of an empty marriage? Or if “The\n            Breakfast Club” was about a young Japanese-American woman in the\n            suburbs of San Francisco just discovering the power of her\n            sexuality? These coming-of-age films — however limited or dated they\n            may seem today — did one specific thing for me when I first watched\n            them: They allowed me to witness the complexity of an individual’s\n            interiority. I saw characters who desired something or someone in\n            life they didn’t have, I saw them stumble and learn from their\n            mistakes and I saw them grow from them. It’s a redemptive,\n            satisfying feeling.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            {\" \"}\n            All stereotypes reduce. Asian-American actors have largely been\n            either fulfillments or denials of clichés. If we are never granted\n            the right to a personality, if we are only perceived as heartless\n            automatons just one point away from a perfect SAT score — then we\n            are certainly never going to be granted the opportunity to live full\n            lives on the screen. Robots, after all, are born fully formed.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Perhaps, other Asian-Americans have argued, we aren’t vocal enough.\n            We don’t get worked up, we don’t cause a fuss. Our parents don’t\n            encourage us to take risks, to rebel. We are too polite, too\n            cautious.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But I don’t buy it. I think that you refuse to see us. To look at us\n            for who we are. As with so many other minorities in America, you are\n            comfortable enjoying the work we make. But representation is about\n            demanding more: more leading Asian-American actors, more films in\n            which we are allowed the everyday banalities of our existence. The\n            anxieties, the boredom, the simple gestures of affection. It’s about\n            showing that you are like us. Not the other way around. Not\n            adjacent. Not other.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            IN ALL ART, the specific is the universal. Today, society can see\n            itself in films that star black people, gay people, older women and\n            transgender people, because even though those stories are about\n            experiences specific to them, they are also stories about being\n            human. There is no perfect outcome in the battle of representation,\n            at least not today, but their presence on screens is a bestowment of\n            dignity, because it demands that society look at them — not past or\n            through them.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In the critic Wesley Yang’s 2011 essay “Paper Tigers,” about the\n            stereotypes surrounding Asian-American overachievers, he\n            consistently returns to the face, his own or that of his subjects:\n            “Sometimes I’ll glimpse my reflection in a window and feel\n            astonished by what I see. Jet-black hair. Slanted eyes. A\n            pancake-flat surface of yellow-and-green-toned skin. An expression\n            that is nearly reptilian in its impassivity.” He speaks with a young\n            man named Jefferson Mao, who aspires to be a writer but recalls his\n            experience at Manhattan’s Stuyvesant High School as being part “of a\n            mob of ‘nameless, faceless Asian kids who were like a part of the\n            décor of the place.’ ” Yang continues: “Here is what I sometimes\n            suspect my face signifies to other Americans: an invisible person,\n            barely distinguishable from a mass of faces that resemble it. A\n            conspicuous person standing apart from the crowd and yet devoid of\n            any individuality. An icon of so much that the culture pretends to\n            honor but that it in fact patronizes and exploits.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When I was 10 years old, I stole a blond wig from the theater camp I\n            attended that summer. I wore it alone in my room. I paraded in front\n            of my mirror with it perched on my head like the feathers of a\n            cockatoo. When it was on, I let myself fantasize about being a white\n            girl. It was then that the more Chinese side of me became visible.\n            The beige and yellow undertones of my skin clashed with the golden\n            yellow of the wig. The almond shape of my brown eyes didn’t sit as\n            well as the pretty blue eyes I imagined having beneath the flaxen\n            bangs. I was trying to erase a side of myself. But in doing so, I\n            only saw myself more clearly.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"col-sm\"></div>\n        {opened[0] && this.redPhoto(a0)}\n        {opened[1] && this.redPhoto(a1)}\n        {opened[2] && this.redPhoto(a2)}\n        {opened[3] && this.redPhoto(a3)}\n        {opened[4] && this.redPhoto(a4)}\n        {opened[5] && this.redPhoto(a5)}\n        {opened[6] && this.redPhoto(a6)}\n        {opened[7] && this.redPhoto(a7)}\n        {opened[8] && this.redPhoto(a8)}\n        {opened[9] && this.redPhoto(a9)}\n        {opened[10] && this.redPhoto(a10)}\n        {opened[11] && this.redPhoto(a11)}\n        {opened[12] && this.redPhoto(a12)}\n        {opened[13] && this.redPhoto(a13)}\n        {opened[14] && this.redPhoto(a14)}\n        {opened[15] && this.redPhoto(a15)}\n        {opened[16] && this.redPhoto(a16)}\n        {opened[17] && this.redPhoto(a17)}\n        {opened[18] && this.redPhoto(a18)}\n        {opened[19] && this.redPhoto(a19)}\n        {opened[20] && this.redPhoto(a20)}\n        {opened[21] && this.redPhoto(a21)}\n        {opened[22] && this.redPhoto(a22)}\n        {opened[23] && this.redPhoto(a23)}\n        {opened[24] && this.redPhoto(a24)}\n        {opened[25] && this.redPhoto(a25)}\n        {opened[26] && this.redPhoto(a26)}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Film2;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport ImageFadeIn from \"react-image-fade-in\";\n\nclass Vehicles3 extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <ImageFadeIn\n        id=\"article-photo3\"\n        src={this.props.photo}\n        opacityTransition=\"2.5\"\n      ></ImageFadeIn>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Vehicles3;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport chart from \"../assets/criterion_chart.png\";\nimport Modal from \"../components/Modal.js\";\nimport Vehicles from \"./article-photo3.js\";\nimport c0 from \"../assets/c0.png\";\nimport c1 from \"../assets/c1.jpeg\";\nimport c2 from \"../assets/c2.jpg\";\nimport c3 from \"../assets/c3.jpg\";\nimport c4 from \"../assets/c4.jpg\";\nimport c5 from \"../assets/c5.jpg\";\nimport c6 from \"../assets/c6.jpg\";\nimport c7 from \"../assets/c7.jpg\";\nimport c8 from \"../assets/c8.jpg\";\nimport c9 from \"../assets/c9.jpg\";\nimport c10 from \"../assets/c10.png\";\nimport c11 from \"../assets/c11.jpg\";\nimport c12 from \"../assets/c12.jpg\";\nimport c13 from \"../assets/f13.jpeg\";\nimport c14 from \"../assets/c14.jpg\";\nimport c15 from \"../assets/c15.jpg\";\nimport c16 from \"../assets/c16.jpg\";\nimport c17 from \"../assets/c17.jpg\";\nimport c18 from \"../assets/c18.jpg\";\nimport c19 from \"../assets/c19.jpg\";\nimport c20 from \"../assets/c20.jpg\";\nimport c21 from \"../assets/c21.jpg\";\nimport c22 from \"../assets/c22.jpg\";\nimport c23 from \"../assets/c23.jpg\";\nimport c24 from \"../assets/c24.jpg\";\nimport c25 from \"../assets/c25.jpg\";\nimport c26 from \"../assets/c26.jpg\";\nimport c27 from \"../assets/c27.jpg\";\nimport c28 from \"../assets/c28.jpg\";\n\nclass Film3 extends Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      opened: [\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n        false,\n      ],\n    };\n    this.toggleBox = this.toggleBox.bind(this);\n    this.redText = this.redText.bind(this);\n    this.redPhoto = this.redPhoto.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  toggleBox(num) {\n    const newItems = [...this.state.opened];\n    newItems[num] = !newItems[num];\n    var i;\n    for (i = 0;

It was September 2016, and\n            Koulisis, a talent agent and former film producer based in Los\n            Angeles, was in New York for a special screening of{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Charles Burnett’s\", 0)} \"\n            {this.redText(\"To Sleep With Anger\", 2)},” a critically admired but\n            little-seen film she had worked on in 1990.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Burnett, who is African-American, was also in town for the\n            screening. And Koulisis, who is white, joined him for an appointment\n            with the Criterion Collection, the producer of a revered DVD and\n            Blu-ray line of classic and contemporary films that has existed in\n            various forms since 1984.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            At the company’s office in Gramercy Park, Koulisis found herself\n            face to face with Peter Becker, Criterion’s longtime president and\n            creative lead, who is also white. Burnett hadn’t come to discuss his\n            own film (he had been asked to record an interview about a film by\n            another director, the Italian Ermanno Olmi), but Koulisis steered\n            the conversation toward “To Sleep With Anger.” No one had ever\n            produced a DVD or Blu-ray of the film, she told Becker. Would\n            Criterion be interested in becoming the first?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The Criterion edition of “To Sleep With Anger” — released less than\n            three years after the meeting with Becker, in 2019 — put Burnett in\n            rarefied company. He is one of only two living Black Americans to\n            have a feature-length film in the collection, which comprises more\n            than 1,000 films by more than 450 directors. There are just four\n            African-American directors with feature films in the collection\n            overall, or less than 1 percent.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If there is a cinematic canon even more highbrow than the Oscars,\n            it’s the Criterion Collection, where directors are treated with a\n            level of awe usually afforded to movie stars and a film’s critical\n            reputation outweighs its box office receipts. Criterion began in the\n            1980s as a producer of high-end laser discs, and pioneered several\n            special features for that format — letterboxing, director’s\n            commentary tracks, deleted scenes — that would later become industry\n            standards. Today, the company, which is privately held, oversees a\n            sister streaming service with an independent catalog — the Criterion\n            Channel — and employs a staff of around 50.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Its physical collection continues to grow by 50 to 60 new or\n            reissued titles each year, all digitally reproduced to exacting\n            specifications and packaged with eye-catching original artwork. It\n            is well known for including works by many of the most highly\n            regarded filmmakers of all time — Alfred Hitchcock, Martin Scorsese,\n            Akira Kurosawa and Jean-Luc Godard among them — alongside a select\n            number of contemporary directors, like Wes Anderson, Guillermo del\n            Toro and Richard Linklater.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            That extensive range has created the impression among some\n            cinephiles, including many who work in the industry, of an\n            authoritative survey. In a recent newsletter circulated by\n            Criterion, Anderson called the collection a “Louvre of movies.” And\n            publications like Vanity Fair and Entertainment Weekly have compared\n            it to a one-stop film school.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “I think in a community of filmmakers, actors and people who are\n            knowledgeable about cinema, that Criterion stamp means a lot,” said\n            Prof. Todd Boyd, the chair for the study of race and popular culture\n            at the University of Southern California. “It’s like a Good\n            Housekeeping seal of approval. It’s a stamp of cultural and\n            filmmaking relevance.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In such an expansive catalog, encompassing films from more than 40\n            countries, the relative absence of African-American filmmakers\n            stands out. There are, for example, more directors in the Criterion\n            Collection with the last name Anderson than there are\n            African-Americans.\n          </p>\n          <span>\n            A New York Times analysis of the collection through June 30 found\n            that of 1,034 feature-length films released by Criterion in the\n            DVD/Blu-ray era, there were...\n          </span>\n          <p>\n            Women and other people of color appeared in slightly larger numbers.\n            About 11 percent of directors were Asian; 2 percent were Latino; and\n            about 7 percent were women.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “When you’re Criterion and you have the ability to stamp something\n            and say, ‘This is valuable,’ but the list only includes certain\n            films and certain filmmakers, that speaks for itself,” Boyd said.\n            “If someone looking at it doesn’t see that many Black filmmakers,\n            without even thinking about it, they’d probably assume that Black\n            filmmakers aren’t that important, or at least they don’t make the\n            kind of critically acclaimed movies you might see in the\n            collection.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            It’s a thorny topic that Black directors have been discussing among\n            themselves for decades.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “You always wanted as a filmmaker to be part of the Criterion\n            Collection, you’re always hoping for that call,” said{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Gina Prince-Bythewood\", 1)}, the director of\n            acclaimed Black-led dramas like “\n            {this.redText(\"Love & Basketball\", 3)}” and “\n            {this.redText(\"Beyond the Lights\", 4)}” Though Criterion has never\n            reached out to her, Prince-Bythewood still feels a rush of\n            anticipation when the company announces new titles. “Every month,\n            they put out an alert about their films coming out, and every month,\n            I open it to see if they’re going to highlight any Black\n            filmmakers,” she said. “And it never happens.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In an interview this month with The New York Times, the Criterion\n            president, Peter Becker, who owns a minority stake in the company,\n            expressed regret about the lack of Black representation in the\n            collection.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “There’s nothing I can say about it that will make it OK,” he said.\n            “The fact that things are missing, and specifically that Black\n            voices are missing, is harmful, and that’s clear. We have to fix\n            that.”\n          </p>\n          <h4>Keepers of the Canon</h4>\n          <p>\n            Though it has released contemporary titles since the laser disc era,\n            the Criterion Collection has deep roots in the classic film canon.\n            Its founders, including the multimedia publishing pioneers Bob Stein\n            and Aleen Stein, the former Warner Bros. executive Roger Smith and\n            the producer Joe Medjuck, started the company in 1984 on the back of\n            two landmarks of American cinema, “Citizen Kane” and “King Kong.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            That same year, Criterion formed a strategic distribution\n            partnership with another company, Janus Films, owned at the time by\n            Becker’s father, William Becker, and Saul J. Turell, father of the\n            current Criterion chief executive, Jonathan Turell. Janus, founded\n            in Harvard Square in 1956, had distinguished itself as among the\n            first American companies to promote foreign art-house films,\n            including the work of Kurosawa, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini and\n            François Truffaut.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Peter Becker, who became president of Criterion in 1997, is also a\n            co-owner of Janus Films. And he inherited its value system, defined\n            by what he described as a “quite canonical and traditional” catalog.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As he sought to expand it, Becker, 56, often looked to films and\n            filmmakers that he felt were cut from a similar cloth. “I was\n            working on what was in front of me based on my own experience and\n            community,” he said.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Over time, that community came to include a contemporaneous\n            generation of North American directors, largely white and male, who\n            idolized Janus Films. Some, including Wes Anderson and Paul Dano\n            (“Wildlife”), became personal friends of Becker’s. Others, like\n            Alexander Payne (“Election”) and Greg Mottola (“The Daytrippers”),\n            appear in promotional materials for Criterion, including popular web\n            videos highlighting its vast DVD closet, and a series of Top 10\n            lists.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            It was to this community that Charles Burnett and Linda Koulisis\n            gained entree after meeting with Becker in 2016, clearing the path\n            for “To Sleep With Anger.” Before their visit, Becker hadn’t seen\n            the film, according to Koulisis.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Amy Heller, president of Milestone Films, another archival movie\n            distributor that released an earlier Burnett title, “\n            {this.redText(\"Killer of Sheep\", 5)},” in 2007, said that many film\n            ranking systems historically have been forged in echo chambers.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “The overwhelming majority of the filmmakers anointed, like the\n            people who chose them, were white men,” she said. “The world they\n            live in affirms their knowledge, acumen, taste and authority.” The\n            result, Heller said, is a canon iterated so often that it can begin\n            to feel “monumental and eternal.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “The folks who are left out of the lists start to become literally\n            personae non grata,” she continued. “Not worth talking about, or\n            hiring, or watching.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Though Burnett succeeded in joining the Criterion set, other Black\n            filmmakers may choose not to make the effort, assuming that they are\n            unwelcome. That was the case for {this.redText(\"Haile Gerima\", 6)},\n            a peer of Burnett’s and the director of the trailblazing “\n            {this.redText(\"Sankofa\", 7)}” (1993). For Gerima, the Criterion\n            Collection brings back memories of what he called the “independent\n            white American film movement” of the 1990s.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “Our experience never allowed us to even think of the possibility of\n            having a relationship with them, because I just feel their very\n            standard is very white supremacist,” he said.\n          </p>\n          <h4>‘Blind Spots’</h4>\n          <p>\n            Becker said that the lack of African-American films in the\n            collection is in part a reflection of his personal “blind spots.”\n            These were at play, for example, in his initial reaction to{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Julie Dash's\", 8)} “\n            {this.redText(\"Daughters of the Dust\", 9)}” (1991), the first\n            theatrically released film directed by an African-American woman.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In 1992, Dash, who studied the Criterion Collection as a graduate\n            film student at the AFI Conservatory and the University of\n            California, Los Angeles, sent Becker a copy of “Daughters” via her\n            distributor, Donald Krim of Kino International. The film, praised by\n            critics for its dreamlike, multigenerational portrayal of a Gullah\n            community on Georgia’s St. Simons Island, is often cited as an\n            influence for Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” But Becker turned it down.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “I didn’t understand what I was looking at,” he said, reflecting on\n            the decision. “I didn’t understand it for what it was. And I wasn’t\n            talking with people who were going to help me.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            At the time, Dash said, she had assumed that Criterion simply didn’t\n            “get” her movie. But she later reconsidered. “It’s more than ‘They\n            don’t get it,’” she said. “It has to do with worldview. They don’t\n            care to get it. They’re not interested.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Though “Daughters” never appeared in the Criterion Collection (in\n            2016, it was reissued in a digitally restored special edition by\n            another company, the Cohen Film Collection), it was added to the\n            Criterion Channel, the company’s streaming service, this spring. In\n            June, following the global protests prompted by the police killing\n            of George Floyd, the film was made available for free on the\n            service, and featured prominently on its home page as part of a\n            special “Black Lives” package.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For Dash, the about-face was a welcome surprise. “What a change,\n            after 30 years,” she said.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Criterion’s blind spots have extended to the most recent generation\n            of African-American filmmakers. Though the collection features the\n            directorial debuts of multiple generations of white auteurs —\n            including Gus Van Sant, Noah Baumbach, David Gordon Green and Lena\n            Dunham — it has no African-American directors born after 1957.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One who potentially could have been included is{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Barry Jenkins\", 10)}, who directed the best-picture\n            winner “{this.redText(\"Moonlight\", 11)}” (2016). Jenkins’s\n            influential debut feature, “\n            {this.redText(\"Medicine for Melancholy\", 12)}” (2009), is\n            distributed by IFC, which has enjoyed a long-running relationship\n            with the Criterion Collection. Other IFC films, including Dunham’s\n            “Tiny Furniture” (2010) and Dano’s “Wildlife” (2018), received\n            Criterion editions within two years of their release.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But Becker, who said he hoped to add “Medicine” to the collection in\n            the near future, acknowledged that he had only recently seen the\n            film: “I will admit that I didn’t know ‘Medicine for Melancholy’\n            when it came out.” He first reached out to Jenkins about acquiring\n            distribution rights in 2018.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The director {this.redText(\"Ava DuVernay\", 13)}, who founded a\n            distribution company, ARRAY, focused on the work of people of color\n            and women, said that Criterion had contributed to “cinema\n            segregation in the art-house circuit.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “There are all these gates that are closed to Black filmmakers,” she\n            said. “It’s a minimizing of the Black film canon. But also it’s a\n            minimizing of the audience, to think that they wouldn’t be\n            interested in Haile Gerima’s ‘{this.redText(\"Sankofa\", 7)},’ or ‘\n            {this.redText(\"Ashes and Embers\", 14)},’ or would not want to see\n            all the work of {this.redText(\"Julie Dash\", 8)}, or{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Kathleen Collins\", 15)}, or{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Charles Burnett\", 0)}, and on and on.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            DuVernay said that Criterion had passed on her own film, “\n            {this.redText(\"Middle of Nowhere\", 16)}” (2012), for which she\n            became the first Black filmmaker to win the directing prize at\n            Sundance. “There wasn’t any rights issue,” said DuVernay, who owns\n            the movie. “It was just a pass.” In an emailed statement, Becker\n            said he had no record or memory of this, and offered to release\n            “Middle of Nowhere” on Blu-ray.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “If Ava would want to work on a special edition with us, we would be\n            honored and would just need her help to get Lionsgate to say yes,”\n            he wrote, referring to the film’s current distributor.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The Criterion Collection wasn’t always quite as white as it is now.\n            In the early 1990s, it put out several acclaimed films by Black\n            directors on laser disc, including{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Melvin Van Peebles’s\", 17)} “\n            {this.redText(\"SweetSweetback’s Baadasssss Song\", 18)},”{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"John Singleton’s\", 19)} “\n            {this.redText(\"Boyz N the Hood\", 20)},”\n            {this.redText(\"Spike Lee’s\", 21)} “\n            {this.redText(\"She’s Gotta Have It\", 22)},” and the{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Hughes brothers\", 23)} films “\n            {this.redText(\"Menace II Society\", 24)}” and “\n            {this.redText(\"Dead Presidents\", 25)}.” But none of those titles\n            survived the transition, in 1998, to DVD.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Becker said they had initially been lost because of rights issues.\n            “In the beginnings of a marketplace, things are less available,” he\n            said. But a significant majority of Criterion’s laser discs did\n            migrate to the newer formats eventually, and Becker acknowledged\n            that he could have done more over the years to reintroduce those by\n            Black filmmakers.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “I know where those rights are, and I can go seek out those rights,\n            and I will,” he said. “We’ve done second Blu-ray editions of other\n            things; we should go do second Blu-ray editions of those, too.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For the Hughes brothers, who said that they had been honored to be\n            included in the collection in the 1990s, the damage has already been\n            done. “How dare that be an oversight?” Albert Hughes said. “You\n            should know better.”\n          </p>\n          <h4>‘We Looked Up and Looked Around’</h4>\n          <p>\n            Becker said his company began trying to address the racial and\n            gender disparities in its catalog around five years ago. That had\n            been one of the objectives of FilmStruck, the now defunct streaming\n            service that Criterion started in partnership with Turner Classic\n            Movies in 2016.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “We looked up, looked around, and went, ‘Oh my God, we have to\n            actually really deal with the fact that, one edition at a time,\n            we’ve knit together something that is almost all male and\n            predominantly white,’” Becker said.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The Criterion Channel, which was begun last year as a spiritual\n            successor to FilmStruck, has been at the forefront of that diversity\n            push, Becker said. Because streaming rights are available at a lower\n            comparative cost to DVD and Blu-ray, and because the Criterion\n            Channel doesn’t require the resource-intensive special features of\n            the physical collection, the company has quickly generated a less\n            homogeneous streaming catalog.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But the physical collection, which has greater cachet among\n            cinephiles and in film schools, has not kept up. In the past five\n            years, out of hundreds of new physical editions, only two — “\n            {this.redText(\"To Sleep With Anger\", 2)}” and “\n            {this.redText(\"Bamboozled\", 26)}” — have been works by Black\n            Americans. Another — a reissue of “\n            {this.redText(\"The Learning Tree\", 27)},” the debut feature by the\n            pioneering African-American director{\" \"}\n            {this.redText(\"Gordon Parks\", 28)} — is planned for next year.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            To diversify the collection, Becker said, he is assembling a\n            “curatorial advisory group” that will work with him to identify\n            acquisition targets, and prevent the exclusion of the next Julie\n            Dash or Barry Jenkins. He also plans to hire more Black employees;\n            there are none currently at leadership levels.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            “We’re just beginning senior leadership coaching for all of our\n            management teams in terms of antiracist hiring practices,” Becker\n            said.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Boyd, of the University of Southern California, said Criterion was\n            an example of how the unexamined racial biases of cultural\n            institutions can have pernicious and long-lasting effects, even\n            without overtly racist intent. “It’s not the ‘segregation today,\n            segregation tomorrow, segregation forever’ kind of racism,” Boyd\n            said. “It’s the sort of racism rooted in assumptions about what’s\n            relevant, what’s significant, what’s worth seeing, what’s\n            important.”\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Near the end of his interview with The Times, Becker said that he\n            had come to recognize as much himself. “I think canons end up being\n            defined as much by what they leave out,” he said, “as by what they\n            let in.”\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Film3;\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { Route, Link, BrowserRouter as Router } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport Film1 from \"./Film1.js\";\nimport Film2 from \"./Film2.js\";\nimport Film3 from \"./Film3.js\";\n\nclass MainPage extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n    this.state = {\n      showHideDemo1: false,\n      showHideDemo2: false,\n      showHideDemo3: false,\n      imgUrl: require(\"../assets/combined_header.png\"),\n      imgHeight: 0,\n      imgUrlGraph: 0,\n      clickCount: 0,\n    };\n    this.hideComponent = this.hideComponent.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", this.listenToScroll);\n  }\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", this.listenToScroll);\n  }\n\n  listenToScroll = () => {\n    const winScroll =\n      document.body.scrollTop || document.documentElement.scrollTop;\n\n    const height =\n      document.documentElement.scrollHeight -\n      document.documentElement.clientHeight;\n\n    var scrolled = (winScroll / height) * 10;\n    var headerBg = document.getElementById(\"blah\");\n    let pic = this.state.imgUrl;\n    let imgHeight = this.state.imgHeight;\n\n    var graphBg = document.getElementById(\"blah1\");\n    let picGraph = this.state.imgUrlGraph;\n  };\n\n  hideComponent(name) {\n    console.log(name);\n    switch (name) {\n      case \"showHideDemo1\":\n        this.setState(\n          {\n            showHideDemo1: true,\n            showHideDemo2: false,\n            showHideDemo3: false,\n            // imgUrl: require(\"../assets/combined_header.png\"),\n            // imgHeight: \"1300px\",\n          },\n          () => window.scrollTo(0, 1300),\n          (document.getElementById(\"blocker\").style.height = \"0px\")\n        );\n        break;\n      case \"showHideDemo2\":\n        this.setState(\n          {\n            showHideDemo1: false,\n            showHideDemo2: true,\n            showHideDemo3: false,\n            // imgUrl: require(\"../assets/combined_header.png\"),\n            // imgHeight: \"1300px\",\n          },\n          () => window.scrollTo(0, 1300),\n          (document.getElementById(\"blocker\").style.height = \"0px\")\n        );\n\n        console.log(this.state);\n        break;\n      case \"showHideDemo3\":\n        this.setState(\n          {\n            showHideDemo1: false,\n            showHideDemo2: false,\n            showHideDemo3: true,\n            // imgUrl: require(\"../assets/combined_header.png\"),\n            // imgHeight: \"1300px\",\n          },\n          () => window.scrollTo(0, 1300),\n          (document.getElementById(\"blocker\").style.height = \"0px\")\n        );\n        break;\n      default:\n        return null;\n    }\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const {\n      showHideDemo1,\n      showHideDemo2,\n      showHideDemo3,\n      imgUrl,\n      imgUrlGraph,\n      imgHeight,\n      clickCount,\n    } = this.state;\n\n    const divStyle = {\n      backgroundImage: \"url(\" + imgUrl + \")\",\n      height: \"1300px\",\n    };\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <div class=\"fade-in\" id=\"header\" style={divStyle}></div>\n        <div class=\"row\" id=\"article-links\">\n          <a onClick={() => this.hideComponent(\"showHideDemo1\")}>\n            Women Made Them.
